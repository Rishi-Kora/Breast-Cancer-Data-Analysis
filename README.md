# Breast-Cancer-Data-Analysis
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for the diagnosis of breast cancer using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnostic dataset. The dataset contains various features extracted from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses. These features describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the images.<br>

The project involves the following steps:<br>

1. Data Loading and Preprocessing: The Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnostic dataset is loaded and preprocessed. This includes handling missing values, converting categorical data to numerical format using label encoding, and removing outliers.<br>

2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Descriptive statistics and visualizations are used to gain insights into the dataset, including feature correlations and distributions.<br>

3. Feature Selection: Relevant features are selected for model training based on their correlation with the target variable and their importance in the dataset.<br>

4. Model Training and Evaluation: A K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier is trained on the preprocessed data. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.<br>

5. Model Optimization: The model is further optimized by tuning hyperparameters, such as the number of neighbors in the KNN algorithm, to improve its predictive performance.<br>

6. Prediction: The trained model is used to predict the diagnosis (benign or malignant) for new, unseen data.<br>
